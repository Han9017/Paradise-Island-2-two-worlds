project proposal:
The members of the project are only me. The main idea of the project is similar to the previous project, which is an adventure game where players explore various parts of the map and ultimately defeat the boss. However, more features and gameplay have been added. For example, the project will feature a new teleportation gameplay, more weapons, backpack restrictions, the ability to check inventory at any time, and the ability to discard weapons at any time. Additionally, a new map have been added, allowing players to teleport to another map.

must-have list:
Transmission function, weapons and tools with different functions, two maps, summoning function (bosses that must gather several items to summon), restricted backpack and discarding item function.

nice-to-have list:
Treasure chests everywhere on the map, Monetary mechanism (can be traded with NPCs), and free map.

similar programs:
My last program, similar gameplay.

Determine your target user:
gamer and coder.
